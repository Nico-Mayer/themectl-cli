# themectl

Manage and apply themes across your tools with one command. Define a theme once
as a `family/variant` (e.g. `catppuccin/mocha`) and `themectl` propagates it to
every configured integration editor, terminal, shell tooling, wallpaper and
system appearance in a single, concurrent pass.

## Usage

```sh
themectl list                 # list all themes (ls)
themectl set catppuccin/mocha # apply a theme (use, apply)
themectl set random           # random theme  (--light / --dark to filter)
themectl current              # print active theme
themectl wallpaper            # print current wallpaper
themectl wallpaper --random   # reshuffle wallpaper for current theme
themectl -v <cmd>             # verbose logs to stderr
```

## Configuration

Everything lives in `~/.config/themectl`. Each theme family is a folder under
`themes/` described by a single `theme.toml`: family-wide `[defaults]` plus one
`[variants.<name>]` table per variant, where a variant overrides individual
fields and inherits the rest. Assets (wallpapers, `nvim.lua`, `eza.yml`, …) sit
next to the spec or in an optional per-variant folder. Global settings go in
`themectl.toml` at the root; the `#:schema` directive on the first line gives
completion and validation in schema-aware TOML editors.

```toml
# themes/catppuccin/theme.toml
#:schema https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nico-Mayer/themectl/main/schemas/theme.schema.json
[defaults]
appearance = "dark"

[defaults.zed]
theme = "Catppuccin Mocha"
icon_theme = "Catppuccin Mocha"
extensions = ["https://github.com/catppuccin/zed"]

[variants.mocha]
# empty table declares the variant; inherits all defaults

[variants.latte]
appearance = "light"

[variants.latte.zed]
theme = "Catppuccin Latte" # icon_theme and extensions inherited
```

```toml
# themectl.toml
#:schema https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nico-Mayer/themectl/main/schemas/settings.schema.json
integrations = ["ghostty", "zed", "wallpaper", "system-appearance"]
default-theme = "catppuccin/mocha"

[config-dirs]
ghostty = "~/.config/ghostty"
zed = "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zed"
```

## Roadmap

### Features

- Expose a color palette per theme so the raycast extension can display it in the theme picker
- `create` command: TUI form that scaffolds a new theme folder in themesDir()
- `install` command: install themes from a GitHub URL
- Allow theme specs to reference assets by URL instead of bundling them (link existing ports, no duplication). Needs network + caching for offline use.
- Add a option in settings to make a integration exclusicve for one operating system or exlude for one
- Philips Hue integration?
- Some way of cleaning installed extensions to force reinstall after (example for zed)

### Missing integrations

- [ ] VSCode
- [ ] Other terminal emulators _(low)_
- [ ] Chromium verify feasibility, may need elevated privileges on macOS to set policies (Helium and other Chromium forks)

### Quick wins
